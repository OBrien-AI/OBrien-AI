- 👋 Hi, I’m @OBrien-AI (Phil O Brien!)
- 👀 I’m interested in reality - I don't trust AI (despite what the username might suggest!)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Danté's Inferno
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on reality
- 📫 How to reach me: Telegram (the old fashioned kind)
- 👀 Pronouns: A pronoun is a word that is used instead of a noun or noun phrase
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was born in a bygone millenium!
